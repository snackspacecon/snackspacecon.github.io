# SnackSpaceCon (BETA)

## About

SnackSpaceCon is an unofficial sidecon running parallel to HackSpaceCon (May 11-15, 2025). It represents the subversive, independent hacker spirit, fueled with quality snacks.

Website: [snackspacecon.com](https://snackspacecon.com)

## Concept

While the main conference follows traditional patterns, SnackSpaceCon operates in the margins – where innovation happens. No corporate sponsors, no surveillance, just edible cookies.

## Features

- **Interactive challenges** testing various security skills
- **Hidden paths and Easter eggs** throughout the site
- **Interactive console** with various commands to explore
- **Original hacker-themed snack concepts**

## Challenges

The site features three main challenges:

1. **Snack Cryptography** - Decode hidden information and create a hacker-inspired snack concept
2. **Shadow CTF** - Find hidden data and navigate through a series of puzzles
3. **DNS Treasure Hunt** - Follow the breadcrumbs through DNS records to discover secrets

## Technical Details

- Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum compatibility and minimal load times
- Retro hacker aesthetic with glitch effects and terminal-style interfaces
- Local storage for tracking challenge progress
- ASCII art and binary motifs throughout

## Manifesto

- Commercial conferences have been compromised
- Vendor halls are surveillance operations
- Conference food is an afterthought, which we remedy with random snack drops
- True innovation happens in the margins
- Complete the challenges, share a slice, and build hacker kinship

## Development

The site is designed to be lightweight and fast-loading, with a strong focus on ASCII-based design and interactive elements. The minimalist approach allows for a nostalgic experience while still providing engaging content.

## Running Locally

1. Clone this repository
2. No build process or dependencies needed - just open index.html in a browser
3. Explore the files to discover hidden features (but don't spoil the fun for others!)
